YouTube Unsubscriber Extension
A simple Chrome extension to help users unsubscribe from YouTube channels directly from the browser. This extension is a work in progress and currently provides the basic UI and functionality for unsubscribing from channels. More advanced features like YouTube API integration will be added soon.

Features
Unsubscribe from channels on YouTube directly through the browser.

Simple and easy-to-use interface with a clean design.

Lightweight: No need for any external applications or complicated setups.

Installation
To install the extension locally:
Download or clone this repository to your local machine.

Open Google Chrome and go to the Extensions page by navigating to chrome://extensions/ in your browser.

Enable Developer Mode by toggling the switch in the top-right corner.

Click Load unpacked and select the folder where you downloaded the extension files.

Once the extension is loaded, you should see the YouTube Unsubscriber icon in your browser's extension bar.

Usage
Click on the YouTube Unsubscriber icon in your browser toolbar.

Click the Unsubscribe from Channels button.

The extension will display a success message once the unsubscription is completed (currently simulated for local use).

Note: This version currently does not perform actual unsubscriptions yet; it is designed to show how the functionality will work once integrated with the YouTube Data API.
